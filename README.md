- [**The WhatsApp Business API**](https://www.whatsapp.com/business/api) client offers many of the features provided by the WhatsApp applications we already know from Android, iOS, and Web. The difference is that this application can be deployed on a server, providing a local API that allows us to programmatically send and receive messages and integrate a workflow.

- [**Using SMS REST API**](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/api), we can send and receive SMS messages, track the delivery of sent messages, and retrieve and modify message history. We are able to deliver SMS to your end-users, no matter where they are, with global senders and redundant telecommunications infrastructure. We’ve solved the challenges of scale with configurable software to power phone number management, sender selection, compliance, content, and replies. 

- [**Voice API**](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice) helps us to make, receive, and monitor calls around the world. Using a REST API, we can make outgoing calls, modify calls in progress, and query metadata about calls created. More advanced call features like programmatic call control, creating conference calls and call queues,  call recordings, and conversational IVRs are possible. 

- [**OpenAI GPT-3 API**](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) provides a general-purpose “text in, text out” interface, which makes it possible to apply it to virtually any language task. This is different from most other languages APIs, which are designed for a single task, such as sentiment classification or named entity recognition.
